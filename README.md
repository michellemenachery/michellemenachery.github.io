## Work Experience
**Software Analyst @ Deloitte USI, Bangalore, India (_June 2021 - July 2023_)**
- Created an AngularJS outage portal for a leading US electric power client, streamlining service management and energy-saving appliance detection. Impacted 10M+ users and conserved energy equal to 60K homes/year.
- Engineered health class and medical appointment portals utilizing AngularJS, HTML, and SCSS for a US care consortium, aiding 12M+ users, reducing no-shows to 6%, crucial during COVID-19 with 40K+ weekly video visits.
- Implemented and deployed interactive LWC chart components utilizing Chart.js, resulting in a 25% increase in user engagement through improved data visualization and informed decision-making.
- Spearheaded effective onboarding of 3 new team members, delivering comprehensive training in JAWS, Analytics, and Agile-Scrum project layout.

**ML Research Analyst @ National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India (_November 2020 - May 2021_)**
- Developed a two-layer forecasting architecture by leveraging Machine Learning models for predicting landslides around the Idukki arch dam site in India. The results were published in the IETE Journal of Research, in a paper titled 'Landslide Classification and Prediction of Debris Flow Using Machine Learning Models.'
- Employed a range of ML models (SVM, decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient-boosting) on balanced data; synthesized layer features, enhancing accuracy and achieving a 20% increase in predictive precision.
- Segmented debris flow into risk zones with predictive probabilities. Enabled focused mitigation in vulnerable areas, reducing harm to life and structures. XGBoost excelled with AUC 0.97 for Debris flow, followed by RF, DT, and SVM.

**Data Scientist Intern @ Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, India (_May 2019 - July 2019_)**
- Built an LSTM-based text classifier for an AI startup nTalents.ai that achieved 97.4% accuracy.
- Identified valuable prospects with a 70% conversion rate, contributing to a significant 25% revenue surge.

## Projects
### Recommender Systems for Movies in Production
Led deployment of movie recommendation service for 1M customers, focusing on scaling and feedback. Trained collaborative filtering models, comparing accuracy and costs. Developed Flask-based inference service for prompt recommendations (<200ms response time). Ensured >99% service uptime through deployment and monitoring, automated testing with Jenkins CI.

### Sentiment Analysis of CGM Discourse on Social Media
Conducted VADER sentiment analysis, frequency analysis, and lemmatization on 37,000+ social media posts about CGM systems to assist healthcare providers.

### Health Diagnostic System
Created a full-stack app for precise disease diagnosis (Pneumonia, Brain tumor, Breast Cancer, Malaria). Employed Deep Learning, ML models, CircleCI for CI/CD, and Docker for containerization.
